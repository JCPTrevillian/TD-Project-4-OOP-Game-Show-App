OOP Game Show App 

In this project I will use JavaScript. This is the sole OOP project out of the 10 projects in the course. 

I created a browser-based, word guessing game: "Phrase Hunter." by using JavaScript and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) to select a random, hidden phrase. A player tries to guess the phrase by selecting individual letters from an onscreen keyboard. If they miss, there are 5 hearts that color in with each failed attemt. These hearts also represent the players' 5 opportunities to guess the phrase.
